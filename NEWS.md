# odin 0.0.3

* Implement caching layer [#54](https://github.com/mrc-ide/odin/issues/54) and possibly enough for [#62](https://github.com/mrc-ide/odin/issues/62).  The interface here is subject to change (currently there is no way to interact with the cache) but should be enough for most cases.  Setting the output directory explicitly will be necessary to cache across sessions.
