Description: Generate systems of ODEs and integrate them, using a
    domain specific language ('DSL').  The 'DSL' uses R's syntax, but
    compiles to C in order to efficiently solve the system.  A solver
    is not provided, but instead interfaces to the packages 'deSolve'
    and 'dde' are generated.  With these, while solving the
    differential equations, no allocations are done and the
    calculations remain entirely in compiled code.  Alternatively, a
    model can be transpiled to R for use in contexts where a C
    compiler is not present.
